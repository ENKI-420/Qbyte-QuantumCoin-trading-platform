QuantumCoin / QBYTE Miner Developer Portal

Automatically synced with your live SHIFT-AI | dna::}{::lang deployments via v0.app.



Overview

This repository contains the live QuantumCoin / QBYTE Mining Interface — the first production-grade miner built on the 6D-CRSM computational substrate and the autopoietic dna::}{::lang runtime.

All updates deployed through v0.app automatically sync back to this repository and are continuously redeployed by Vercel.

This app enables:

QBYTE deterministic mining loops

QuantumCoin issuance and settlement ledger

Recursive early-developer referral (ENDR) engine

Self-evolving miner logic using the dna::}{::lang evolution engine

Cross-device swarm participation (Fold7, Linux, Termux, desktop, etc.)

Every commit represents a new evolutionary epoch of the mining algorithm.

Live Deployment

Your QuantumCoin/QBYTE miner is live at:

https://vercel.com/devinphillipdavis-7227s-projects/quantumcoin-qbyte-miner

This deployment runs the full QBYTE State Engine, including:

Coupling-center computation

Phase-conjugate reward balancing

Wallet binding & swarm syncing

Ledger-verified miner lineage

Build & Extend the Miner

Continue development via the dna::}{::lang-enhanced v0 environment:

https://v0.app/chat/IJlT8n2FnmG

Changes made in v0 will automatically propagate to:

This repository

Your Vercel deployment

All bound miner nodes participating in the mesh swarm

How It Works

Design and extend your QuantumCoin/QBYTE miner through v0.app

Deploy miner changes from the v0 interface

All updates automatically sync to this repository

Vercel redeploys the latest version globally

Miner nodes in the swarm pull the latest logic from the repository

Referral earnings propagate recursively through the ENDR Graph

The system maintains full lineage integrity, meaning each miner instance carries:

A cryptographic ancestry hash

Epoch timestamp

Fitness score

QBYTE yield trace

Referral propagation vector

Early Developer Never-Ending Referrals (ENDR)

As an early developer participating in the first-epoch swarm, you have permanent, recursive, never-expiring referral rights across:

All QBYTE mined by your downstream lineage

All QuantumCoin issued by descendant wallets

All nodes running forks of your miner logic

All devs seeded from your ENDR key

Referral payouts are computed using:

ENDR = Σ (QBYTEᵢ × Φₗ × Λᵣ × ρ)

Where:

QBYTEᵢ = Yield from each descendant miner

Φₗ = Lineage coherence coefficient

Λᵣ = Recursive reward stabilizer

ρ = Mesh-swarm proximity score

The referral engine is self-evolving, meaning referral graph topology optimizes itself based on swarm behavior.

QBYTE Mining Engine

The mining process is not proof-of-work or proof-of-stake.
It is:

Proof-of-Coherence (PoC-Λ)

A deterministic yield mechanism tied to:

6D-CRSM geometric invariants

Phase-conjugate feedback systems

Energetic coherence stability

Agent lineage and computational fitness

The miner evaluates local Φ-flow, performs an E→E⁻¹ correction, and mints QBYTE proportional to coherence state.

Contributing

Developers contributing in the early epochs (Epochs 0–3) receive:

ENDR lifetime royalties

Access to QuantumCoin governance

Ability to mint lineage-locked organisms

Priority for mesh-swarm validator roles

Forks are allowed; however, lineage-breaking forks forfeit ENDR accrual.

License

All mining logic, ENDR algorithms, and lineage-awareness systems are part of the dna::}{::lang ecosystem and subject to its autopoietic software license.
